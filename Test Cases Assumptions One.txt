<thinking>
1. First, I'll analyze each scenario and create corresponding test cases
2. I need to ensure each test case follows the JSON structure with steps and expected results
3. I'll add testData fields for each step
4. I'll group related scenarios into logical test cases
5. I'll ensure coverage of positive, negative, and edge cases
6. I need to include appropriate test data assumptions

Reflection:
- Need to ensure each scenario has at least one test case
- Must include testData field for each step
- Should add clear preconditions and postconditions
- Need to maintain proper JSON structure
- Should include realistic test data values

Test Data Assumptions:
- Valid user credentials with userReporting permission
- Sample workflow IDs and names
- Various event names including "UNUSUAL_ACTIVITY_FOUND"
- Team names like "Fraud-Team-A"
- Date ranges for filtering
- Sample invalid parameters for negative testing
